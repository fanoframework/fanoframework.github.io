<h1 class="major">Creating Hello World web application With Fano CLI</h1>

In this step by step tutorial, we are going to create a simple CGI web application which displays greeting message using Fano CLI. Read [Scaffolding with Fano CLI](/scaffolding-with-fano-cli) for more information.

## Who is this tutorial for?

This tutorial is written for anyone new to Fano Framework. It is assumed that you have proficiency with Free Pascal and its language syntax. You are familiar with  Linux command and and its shell terminal.

## Requirement

- [Free Pascal >= 3.0](https://www.freepascal.org)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Apache 2.4](https://httpd.apache.org/)
- Text editor, vim, VSCode, Atom etc.
- [Fano CLI](https://github.com/fanoframework/fano-cli). Read [Fano CLI installation](/scaffolding-with-fano-cli/#installation) or [view video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B42X_WB_iPs)
- Working Internet connection.
- Root privilege.

## Create Project

Make sure that all requirements are met. To create a CGI project, run

```
$ fanocli --project-cgi=Hello
```

Wait until new project is created. If everything is ok, your project will be created inside `Hello` directory. Change active directory to `Hello` directory.

```
$ cd Hello
```

All actions below is assumed to take place inside `Hello` directory.

## Build application

Run

```
$ ./build.sh
```

Wait until compilation is finished.

## Setup web server configuration

Run

```
$ sudo fanocli --deploy-cgi=hello.fano
```

## Access application from browser

Open web browser and go to `http://hello.fano`. You should see *Fano Application Error* page. It is normal as you have not create any route to handle the request.

## Create a controller

Run

```
$ fanocli --controller=Home
```

Command above will create `HomeController.pas` in `src/App/Home/Controllers` directory and register route `/home` so you will be able to access it via URL `http://hello.fano/home`.

Rebuild application by running,

```
$ ./build.sh
```

After compilation is finished, open web browser and go to `http://hello.fano/home`. You should see text `Home controller` printed. Congratulations, your application is working.

## Creating default route

However, if you open, `http://hello.fano`, you will still get *Fano Application Error* page. To fix it, you need to add route to `/`.

With your favorite text editor, open `src/Routes/routes.inc` file and add following line.

```
router.get('/', container.get('homeController') as IRequestHandler);
```

Rebuild application

```
$ ./build.sh
```

With web browser, go ahead and open `http://hello.fano`. *Fano Application Error* page is disappeared.
