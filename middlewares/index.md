## Why middleware?

In Fano Framework, middleware is an optional software component that is executed before or after request is passed to actual request handler. It is similar concept to firewall, in which, it can pass, block or modify [request](/working-with-request) or [response](/working-with-response).

For example, middleware allows developer to test if user is logged in before request reaches controller. If user is not logged in, it blocks request.
So when controller is executed, developer can be sure that user must be logged in.

One or more middleware instances can be attached to one or more [routes](/working-with-router). This allows centralized action to be taken for multiple controllers.

So, instead of tedious check each time controller is executed,

```
function TMy1Controller.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader
) : IResponse;
var sess : ISession;
begin
    sess := fSessionMgr[request];
    if sess.has('loggedIn') then
    begin
        result := doSomething1WhenUserLoggedIn(request, response, args);
    end else
    begin
        result := doSomethingWhenUserNotLoggedIn(request, response, args);
    end;
end;
...
function TMy2Controller.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader
) : IResponse;
var sess : ISession;
begin
    sess := fSessionMgr[request];
    if sess.has('loggedIn') then
    begin
        result := doSomething2WhenUserLoggedIn(request, response, args);
    end else
    begin
        result := doSomethingWhenUserNotLoggedIn(request, response, args);
    end;
end;
```

You create one middleware that will check if user is logged in and attach it to any routes that must be accessible only to logged in user.

```
function TAuthMiddleware.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader;
    const next : IRequestHandler
) : IResponse;
var sess : ISession;
begin
    sess := fSessionMgr[request];
    if sess.has('loggedIn') then
    begin
        //user is logged in
        result := next.requestHandler(request, response, args);
    end else
    begin
        result := doSomethingWhenUserNotLoggedIn(request, response, args);
    end;
end;
```

Then controllers become more simple as you can assume that when execution reach controller,
user must be logged in.

```
function TMy1Controller.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader
) : IResponse;
begin
    result := doSomething1WhenUserLoggedIn(request, response, args);
end;
...
function TMy2Controller.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader
) : IResponse;
begin
    result := doSomething2WhenUserLoggedIn(request, response, args);
end;
```

Read [Working with Session](/working-with-session) for information about session.

## Middleware architecture in Fano Framework

Fano Framework use simple chained middleware list. Each middleware can decide whether to pass request to next middleware or block. If middleware blocks a request, it must return response.

<a href="/assets/images/middlewares.svg">
<img src="/assets/images/middlewares.svg" alt="Middleware diagram" width="100%">
</a>

In Fano Framework, any class implements `IMiddleware` interface can be used as middleware. This interface has one methods `handleRequest()` which class must implement.

```
function handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader;
    const next : IRequestHandler
) : IResponse;
```
- `request` is current request object
- `response` is current response object
- `args` is current route arguments. Read [Working with Router](/working-with-router#getting-route-argument) for more information about route argument.
- `next` is next middleware to execute

If a middleware should let execution to continue, it must call `next` request handler, otherwise execution stops and response that is returned by middleware's `handleRequest()` method will be response what client browser received.

For example, following code will stop execution if request is not AJAX request otherwise it will continue execution.

```
function TAjaxOnlyMiddleware.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader;
    const next : IRequestHandler
) : IResponse;
begin
    if (not request.isXhr()) then
    begin
        response.headers().setHeader('Status', '403 Not Ajax Request');
        result := response;
    end else
    begin
        result := next.handleRequest(request, response, args);
    end;
end;

```

## Type of middlewares

### Based on scope

#### Application middleware

Application middleware is middleware that is attached and applied globally to all routes.

#### Route middleware

Route middleware is middleware that is attached and applied to one or more specific routes.

### Based on order of execution

### Before middleware

Before middleware is any middleware that is executed *before* controller execution. This is mostly type of middleware that can be used to modify request or to act as gate that block or pass request.

```
function TMyMiddleware.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader;
    const next : IRequestHandler
) : IResponse;
begin
    doSomething();
    result := next.handleRequest(request, response, args);
end;

```

### After middleware

After middleware is any middleware that is executed *after* controller execution.

```
function TMyMiddleware.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader;
    const next : IRequestHandler
) : IResponse;
begin
    result := next.handleRequest(request, response, args);
    doSomething();
end;
```
### Before and after middleware

Combination of both, before and after,

```
function TMyMiddleware.handleRequest(
    const request : IRequest;
    const response : IResponse;
    const args : IRouteArgsReader;
    const next : IRequestHandler
) : IResponse;
begin
    doSomething1();
    result := next.handleRequest(request, response, args);
    doSomething2();
end;
```
## Creating middleware

```
var ajaxOnly : IMiddleware;
    authOnly : IMiddleware;
...
ajaxOnly := TAjaxOnlyMiddleware.create();
authOnly := TAuthOnlyMiddleware.create();
```

## <a name="attaching-middleware-to-application-middleware"></a>Attaching middleware to application middleware

When you use initialize `IDispatcher` implementation which support middlewares, such as `TDispatcher` class, you are required to setup one global `IMiddlewareLinkList` instances which stores list of middlewares applied globally to all routes. Read [Dispatcher](/dispatcher) for more information.

As shown in following code

```
{-----------------------------------------------
  register middleware list for application
------------------------------------------------}
container.add('appMiddlewares', TMiddlewareListFactory.create());
```

In you dispatcher initialization, you need to set global middlewares collection to use by dispatcher instance.

```
{-----------------------------------------------
  setup basic application request dispatcher
  which support middleware
------------------------------------------------}
container.add(
    'dispatcher',
    TDispatcherFactory.create(
        container.get('appMiddlewares') as IMiddlewareLinkList,
        aRouterInst as IRouteMatcher,
        TRequestResponseFactory.create()
    )
);
```

and then you can register a middleware to application middlewares as follows

```
var appMiddlewares : IMiddlewareList;
...
appMiddlewares := container.get('appMiddlewares') as IMiddlewareList;
appMiddlewares.add(authOnly);
```

If you do not need application middleware list, you can use null class as shown in following code,

```
container.add('appMiddlewares', TNullMiddlewareListFactory.create());
```

This will create `TNullMiddlewareList` class instance which basically does nothing.

## Creating project with middleware support with Fano CLI

When creating project with [Fano CLI](/scaffolding-with-fano-cli), you can automate task to setup middleware support with `--with-middleware` command line argument. Read [Add middleware support](/scaffolding-with-fano-cli#add-middleware-support) section for more information.

## Creating middleware with Fano CLI

[Fano CLI](/scaffolding-with-fano-cli) provides middleware creation command `--middleware` to simplify task for creating and setting up middleware with dependency container. Read [Creating Middleware](/scaffolding-with-fano-cli#creating-middleware) section for more information.

## Attaching middleware to route

When you register the controller to route, you can add middleware as shown in following code

```
router.get(
    '/hi/{name}',
    hiController
).add(authOnly);

router.post(
    '/hi/{name}',
    hiController
).add(ajaxOnly)
.add(authOnly);
```

## Built-in middlewares

Fano Framework provides several built-in middlewares.

- `TNullMiddleware`, middleware class that does nothing and just pass the request.
- `TCompositeMiddleware`, middleware class which group several middlewares as one.
- `TRequestHandlerAsMiddleware`, adapter middleware which can turn request handler as a middleware.
- `TCorsMiddleware`, middleware class which adds CORS response header. Read [Handling CORS](/security/handling-cors) for more information.
- `TCsrfMiddleware`, middleware class which adds CSRF protection. Read [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](/security/csrf-protection) for more information.
- `TValidationMiddleware`, middleware class which validate request. Read [Form Validation](/security/form-validation) for more information.
- `TJsonContentTypeMiddleware`, middleware class which handle request with `application/json` in its header. For more information, read [Handling request with JSON body](/working-with-request#handling-request-with-json-body).
- `TCacheControlMiddleware`, middleware class which adds `Cache-Control` response header. For more information, read [Http cache header](/working-with-response/http-cache-header).
- `TStaticFilesMiddleware`, middleware class which serves static files. For more information, read [Serving static files](/working-with-response/serve-static-files).

### Group several middlewares as one

For example if you have following route registration which each of routes is using same
middlewares

```
router.get(
    '/hello/{name}',
    helloController
).add(cors)
.add(authOnly)
.add(ajaxOnly);

router.get(
    '/hi/{name}',
    hiController
).add(cors)
.add(authOnly)
.add(ajaxOnly);
```

You can simplify it to become

```
router.get(
    '/hello/{name}',
    helloController
).add(corsAuthAjax);

router.get(
    '/hi/{name}',
    hiController
).add(corsAuthAjax);
```

where `corsAuthAjax` middleware is defined as follows

```
var corsAuthAjax : IMiddleware;
...
corsAuthAjax := TCompositeMiddleware.create([cors, authOnly, ajaxOnly]);
```

### Use controller as a middleware

`TRequestHandlerAsMiddleware` is an adapter middleware that allows instance of `IRequestHandler` interface to be used as `IMiddleware`. It means you can wrap a controller instance and attach it to a route and to be executed as part of middleware chain. However, controller instance used this way can not block request but only can modify request and/or response because `TRequestHandlerAsMiddleware` class always passes request to next middleware.

```
var helloCtrlMiddleware : IMiddleware;
    helloController : IRequestHandler;
...
helloCtrlMiddleware := TRequestHandlerAsMiddleware.create(helloController);
```

## Performance consideration

Using middleware adds overhead as request must go multiple execution points before reaching actual request handler. Also, you need to aware that each middleware will call next middleware recursively so you should limit number of middlewares in use.
